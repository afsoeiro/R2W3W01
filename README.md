# Road to Web3, Challenges from Week 01
This is my repository created to host the challenges for Road to Web3 in the firsty week.

The tutorials create a Smart Contract (using the Solidity language) and deploy it. The smart contract is able to mint an ERC721 NFT. In the tutorial, the NFT gets minted using the Remix IDE, and we interact with the deployed smart contract using the interface provided by the Remix IDE. Also, the video tutorial used Rinkerby, warning that it was about to be discontinued by the Ethereum merge.

In this version, I have brought all files to my home computer, and built the app using tools like VisualStudio Code, Npm and HardHat. To provide an interface for users to interact with the created smart contract, I have put up a website frontend. The frontend is not more than a stripped down version of the website created in Road to Web3's week 2, called "Buy me a Coffee". Instead of Rinkerby, I have implemented my smart contract in the Polygon Mumbai network. The node to interact with the smart contract comes from Alchemy (which I believe is the main sponsor for the Road to the Web3 tutorials website).

In this very moment, I have my fingers crossed in the hope that I am able to host this website in Cloudfare.
